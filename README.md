### Matthew 5:1-12
```
Introduction to the Sermon on the Mount
5 Now when Jesus saw the crowds, he went up on a mountainside and sat down. His
disciples came to him, 2 and he began to teach them.

The Beatitudes
He said:

3 “Blessed are the poor in spirit,
    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.
4 Blessed are those who mourn,
    for they will be comforted.
5 Blessed are the meek,
    for they will inherit the earth.
6 Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
    for they will be filled.
7 Blessed are the merciful,
    for they will be shown mercy.
8 Blessed are the pure in heart,
    for they will see God.
9 Blessed are the peacemakers,
    for they will be called children of God.
10 Blessed are those who are persecuted because of righteousness,
    for theirs is the kingdom of heaven.

11 “Blessed are you when people insult you, persecute you and falsely say all
kinds of evil against you because of me. 12 Rejoice and be glad, because great
is your reward in heaven, for in the same way they persecuted the prophets who
were before you.
```

# Notes & Quotes

Matthew 5: Sermon on the mount! Most famous sermon ever given.

Every person has asked themselves... "How can I be Happy?"
- #1 Google autocomplete w/ phrase "How can I be..."

Jesus answers this question during the Sermon on the Mount, giving 8 ways to
achieve happiness. Just note: they are totally & utterly counter-intuitive...
that is, they don't jive with what the world says would make you happy. BUT,
they are also pretty logical, so they'll make sense.

# Blessed are the...

## Poor in spirit

Understanding "poverty in spirit" will help us understand all the other
characteristics with ease.

- it means you don't have sufficient resources within yourself to face 
  life's challenges.
- has less to do with being "rich" or "poor", but whether you embrace daily
  dependence on God for what you need.
- "petokas" - people who were so despised in society, that they were spit on. 
  This is the poor that Jesus says will inherit the kingdom of God.

### Parable: two men arrive at the temple to pray

- one is an elite leader, with no gross immoral sin. He sits at the front of 
  church & essentially prays to himself, thanking the Lord for his blessings.
- the other is a tax collector, overwhelmed with his guilt. He lays face down at
  the back of the room and begs for forgiveness.

Jesus says the second man left the temple "right with God". Converserly, since
the first man's posture embodied a certain richness about his own righteousness,
that's what he left the temple with... no righteousness was added.

### God only fills empty hands

What keeps you from being right with God is your perceived moral **ability**. You
are blinded to your need for grace. You need to know & acknowledge this fact:
"I can't be good enough to earn your favor".

Understanding this truth helps us apply the principle across the broad spectrum
of the christian life:
- Those who feel capable as parents, will not experience the power of God in
  their parenting. Your kid isn't going to get screwed up by your poor
  parenting but rather, your kid will get screwed up by your confidence in 
  your "good parenting".
- The same is true for...
    - Our relationships
    - Our careers

### Rich In Spirit = corrupt spirit = unhappy

Not only does being rich in spirit keep us cut off from God's help, but it also 
corrupts our spirits. And this is what keeps us from being happy. How?
- Being rich, makes us proud and pride gives makes us distainful of others.
- Basically, pride makes your life an endless cycle of comparison & competition
- For example, "it doesn't matter if I'm not X, as long as I'm more X than you."
    - smarter, prettier, more wealthy, etc
- People who are prideful can't get along with each other - their pride is
  always conflicted with others who are prideful. So a good measure of whether
  or not you are prideful is if someone else's pride ticks you off. If someone
  else thinks their something, they they think they are better than you, and
  that grinds my gears.
- Competition (pride) makes us incredibly "me focused".
  - That's why we don't post about our desperation, but our surplus

Makes you ungrateful. You feels as though someone always owes you something.
Instead, you should ask the Lord, "Why me? Why the smallest man from the smallest
tribe?"



## Those who mourn

A willingness to enter the pain of others - or being "relationally connected" to
others. Jesus' most famous parable - the good samaritan - provides the perfect
example of this. The Samaritan entered into the pain of someone else (who was
robbed and beaten) on the side of the road, and took care of him. The longer we
live, we generally gravitate towards becoming more isolated becauses relationships
are messy and take a lot of work. Even attending small group. It's hard to share
problems your having in your marriage for example. "I'd rather not." People just
want a quiet life with with their cars, house, and routine. Jesus says that
you'll never become happy that way. Blessed are the...

- foster parents
- involved in ministries to the widow, the prisoner, the unwed mothers, the high
  school dropout.
- sponsor compassion kids
- go overseas on missions trips
- identify with a community that is not your own


## The meek

Meekness is taking 2nd place over 1st place whenever you can. It means using
your power & position to serve others and not yourself. Jesus, the Lord & master
of the universe - washes the disciples feet. When you humble yourself, God begins
to elevate / exalt you.

Let's say you are watching your kid as school. You see him split his lunch in half
and give it to another kid who never has his own lunch or may not even eat any meals
at home. How does that make you feel? You feel proud! Maybe you reward them with
30 oreos because he gave away 3. God looks at His children the same way. And you
can't out give God.

What if you consciencely took 2nd place instead of first?
- you'd be insanely happy
- God would shower blessings down on you in this life & the next


## Those who Hunger & thirst for righteousness

Craving fellowship with God above everything else - peeps with those attributes will
actually get filled. King Solomon explained that God put eternity in our hearts.
We have a God shaped hole in our hearts, and nothing else will fit. Our souls crave
God.

## The merciful

## The pure of heart

## The pacemakers

## Those who are persecuted because of their righteousness
